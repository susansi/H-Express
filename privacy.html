All security issues that are discovered during assessments must be mitigated based upon the following risk levels. 
a) High – Any high risk issue must be fixed immediately or other mitigation strategies must be put in place to limit 
exposure before deployment. Applications with high risk issues are subject to being taken off-line or denied release 
into the live environment.
b) Medium – Medium risk issues should be reviewed to determine what is required to mitigate and scheduled accordingly. 
 Applications with medium risk issues may be taken off-line or denied release into the live environment based on the 
 number of issues and if multiple issues increase the risk to an unacceptable level. Issues should be fixed in a patch/
 point release unless other mitigation strategies will limit exposure.
c) Low – Issue should be reviewed to determine what is required to correct the issue and scheduled accordingly.
